Log4Steve
=========

Please note, Log4Steve has now been put into a house with other friends. He now lives at: https://github.com/shearnie/Shearnie.Net

Because for me, Log4Net sucks to configure.

Nothing to reference, no crappy xml to fiddle with. No elaborate project/solution, and no tests.
Just a single class you can add into your code and step through if it's not behaving.
